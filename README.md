Introduction 

For conservationist NGOs, communication is close to a work of persuasion (Núñez & Moreno, 2016) as it needs to both increase awareness of people and encourage behavioural change. However, closing the gap between communication and engagement is a challenging task as it is often harder to encourage the public to participate in conservation activities than to make them aware of conservation work being done. This challenge is more apparent in the context of social media communication as messages that are rapidly and dynamically spread do not necessarily entail involvement and engagement (Dosemagen, 2016). Therefore, making social media users ultimately engage in conservationist content is an essential challenge that conservationist groups need to overcome.
To find a solution for the problem, it is of great significance to learn how social media communication generate engagement. In particular, it is to know what type of content can encourage engagement from audience, especially active and pro-active engagement.
This analysis tries to answer the research question: "Which type content on Facebook page of conservationist NGOs generate more active engagement?".
Firstly, the research would test if the common claim that photo got the highest engagement rate while status receives the lowest engagement rate (Schwartz, 2017) applies to the case. Sub-research question 1 therefore is:
Which medium of content (photo, video, status, link) generates the highest level of engagement? 
Does the length of post, content's sentiments, or inclusion of question help increase engagement?
Content of posts plays a role in engagement of audience. It is argued that the public is more likely to make comments on two-way asymmetry communication as this appears as an effort of the organizations to build relationships with them (Cho, Schweickart, & Haase, 2014, pp. 566-567). Hence, sub-research question 2, 3 and 4 is: 
Which type of content would generate more engagement by audience? Is it neutral knowledge sharing, call-in-action activist, or critic content that makes people more prone to voice their ideas? 
Lastly, as argued a rule of thumb for social media content, shorter content is more likely to  attract engagement (Jackson, 2017), hypothesis 5 is decided as:
Inspection and cleaning of data:
c

Dependent variables: 
Primary: likes count, comment count, share count, reaction count: provided
Secondary: comment sentiment, reaction sentiment
Independent variables: 
RQ1: type of post 
RQ2: post component: length of post, sentiment of post, question inclusion
RQ3: type of content:

evaluation: 
From above data analysis, two important results are obtained. Firstly, two factors that have the most significant effect on engagement are type and sentiment of posts. They have effects on most engagement measurement. For post type, photo is the most engaging type while video is the least. That visual factor is present in all type, no matter it is link or video might be the reason why the difference among post type groups is not strong. It is also noteworthy that sentiment of post has significant effect on sentiment of comment and reactions by audience. Secondly, no independent variable has significant effect on the number of comments. The result can be partly explained by the fact that the number of comments is much smaller than numbers of other engagement metrics. Another finding is that, against the hypotheses, question inclusion or call-in-action content seem to have negative effect on most engagement metrics, though not significantly. 
limitation and next step: 
The analysis is not out of limitations. Firstly, like other quantitative analysis, this data analysis plan runs the risk of losing in-depth information through generalization of materials. Content-wise variables defined by simplified techniques cannot present all aspect of the content, which should be improved by a more thorough research plan including more human interaction. 
Besides, not every aspect of the issue is dealt with in this analysis. Factors such as publishing time or graphic characteristics may also have effect on engagement but were not studied. Further analysis on these factors are necessary to fully study Facebook engagement.
Lastly, it is easier to do descriptive analysis with Facebook data than finding reasons behind audience behaviours, therefore further examination should be paid to the exploration of motivation for engagement (Mahrt & Scharkow, 2013, p.23). 

ethical, privacy, normative problems:
The use of data from the Facebook page of World Wildlife Fund in this research does not pose an ethical problem as severe as privacy invasion because the organization uses data from its own social media account. Regarding analysis of engagement made by audience, it can be argued that as the activities studied are made on a public Facebook page rather than personal ones, they indeed exist in a public realm. Still, the ethical issue with this type of research is equivalent to that applies to public observation research, both lack an informed consent from unknowing participants. However, as the researched is conducted unknowingly, this plan could study the absolute behaviours of social media users, examining what people really do rather than what they report doing (Rieder, 2013, p.347). This excludes experimental effects that may distort behaviour due to human interaction (Mahrt & Scharkow, 2013, p.24).
Finally, one normative issue to be concerned is that Facebook engagement does not represent real-life engagement and it is difficult to define the connection between the two. Speaking from the viewpoint that conservationist communication emphasises behavioural change, social media engagement that does not translate into reality is of little significance to NGO engagement.
